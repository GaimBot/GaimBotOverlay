# GaimBotOverlay

Currently works on Android. iOS support will probably be out tomorrow along with this repo not looking like a mess.

## Setup

1. Replace <yougamebotrurl> with the URL to your game bot instance in all locations (AndroidManifest.xml and gaimbotwebview.dart)
2. Run. Try not to get mad since the UI is bad.
